# Hierarchical Clustering Example
A simple clustering algorithm using securities data.
All the data have been generated randomly following a normal distribution.

The clusters n=3 where selected using dendrogram where the clusters data
inside each one is as similar as possible.

In this example there are 3 main features of the data: volume, No. of trades
and trading frequency. The features are reduced to two dimensions, each one important to determine de liquidity of a certain security.

The dimensionality reduction follows a simple PCA.
